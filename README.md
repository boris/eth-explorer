# Ethereum Blockchain Explorer

## Why?
_just for fun_... and to learn more about the Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum
nodes and do some coding.

## What is this?
A very simple page that will diplay:
- The last 10-_ish_ blocks mined
- A like to the block showing what's inside it

# How to run it?
1. Clone this repo
1. Create a python virtual environment (I'm using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)), might not be the best way to do it, but it what it is. In any case, I included a `make dev-setup` that will create a virtual environment for you.
1. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run the app: `make run`
